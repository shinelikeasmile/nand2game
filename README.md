# Nand2Game
## Building a Modern Computer from First Principles
based on the book ["The Elements of Computer Systems by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems)
which exposes students to a significant body of computer science knowledge, gained through a series of hardware & software construction tasks. These tasks demonstrate how theoritical and applied techniques taught in other computer science courses are used in practice.<br />

This repository contains all the completed tasks along with summaries of all the chapters in the book.

## Structure of the book
It contains 12 chapters, each dedicated to a key hardware or software abstraction,a proposed implementation, and an actual project that builds and tests it. The following picture shows the sequence of projects.<br />

## 1. Boolean Logic
* Boolean Gates are physical implementations of boolean functions.
* A boolean function is a function that operates on binary inputs and returns outputs.
* The simplest way to specify a Boolean function is truth table representation. 
* A boolean function can also be specified using boolean operations over its input variables : Boolean expression 
* Every Boolean function,no matter how complex, can be expressed using three Boolean operators only : canonical representation.
* Canonical representation : we OR-together all the terms for all the rows where the function has value 1.
* The no.of boolean function that can be defined over n binary variables is 2<sup>2</sup><sup><sup>n</sup></sup>
* if x then y also known as x implies y ( x -> y ) returns 1 when x is 0 or when both are x and y are 1 (Not(x) + y ).
* And , Or and Not can be constructed from Nand or Nor gates.
* Every Boolean functions can be contructed from Nand operations alone.
* A gate is a physical device that implements a Boolean function.
* logic design is the art of interconnecting gates in order to implement more complex functionality.
* Hardware Description Language (HDL)
* Multi-Bit Multiplexor : An n-bit multiplexor is exactly the same as the binary multiplexor, except that the two inputs are each n-bit wide; the selector is a single bit.
* Multi-Way/Multi-Bit Multiplexor : An m-way n bit multiplexor selects one of m n-bit input buses and outputs it to a single n-bit output bus. The selection is specified by a set of k control bits, where k = log<sub>2</sub>m.
* Multi-Way/Multi-Bit Demultiplexor : An m-way n bit demultiplexor channels a single n-bit input into one of m possible n-bit outputs. The selection is specified by a set of k control bits, where k=log<sub>2</sub>m.
#### Project 1: Implement commonly used 15 logic gates using Nand gate as primitive gate.

## 2. Boolean Arithmetic 
* The ALU is the centerpiece chip that executes all the arithmetic and logical operations performed by the computer.
* For representing signed bit numbers in binary code we use Two's complement method(radix complement).
* Two's complement of a number x is defined as 2<sup>n</sup>-x.
* One's complement of x is -(x+1) in two's complement representation.
* To get -x from x, leave all the trailing(LSB) 0's and the first least significant 1 intact, then flip all the remaining bits.
#### Project 2: Implemention of ALU.

## 3. Sequential Logic
* Combinational chips can perform processing but they cannot maintain state.
* memory elements are built from sequential chips.
* flip flop is the most elementary sequential unit. we use DFF out(t)=in(t-1).
* DFF simply outputs the input value from the previous time unit.
* [Flip Flops Theory](/images/dld.png)

* Register : A register is a storage device that can store or remember a value over time i.e out(t)=out(t-1).
