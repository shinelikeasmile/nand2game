## Building a Modern Computer from First Principles
based on the book ["The Elements of Computer Systems by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems)
which exposes students to a significant body of computer science knowledge, gained through a series of hardware & software construction tasks. These tasks demonstrate how theoritical and applied techniques taught in other computer science courses are used in practice.<br />

This repository contains all the completed tasks along with summaries of all the chapters in the book.

## Structure of the book
It contains 12 chapters, each dedicated to a key hardware or software abstraction,a proposed implementation, and an actual project that builds and tests it. The following picture shows the sequence of projects.<br />
