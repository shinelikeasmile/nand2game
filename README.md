based on the book ["The Elements of Computer Systems by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems)
which exposes students to a significant body of computer science knowledge, gained through a series of hardware and software construction tasks. These tasks demonstrate how theoritical and applied techniques taught in other computer science courses are used in practice.<br />
This repository contains all the completed tasks along with summaries of all the chapters in the book.
